# pico_c
Raspberyy Pi Pico code / applications

The code is a direct copy from https://github.com/Jean-MarcHarvengt/MCUME
all rights etc.. belong to that chap.

I just got it running / working on a PICOZX using RGB222 as it now gets me all the colours.

About a year ago, I did attempt this on a PicoVGA https://github.com/pi-gram/pico_c/tree/main/MCUME_pico_picodemo_VGA
however, I did not get the colours working nor a keyboard.

A year later, I believe the code will work on the PicoVGA - if you replace the SDCard code (which I did do before)
I did attempt it, but then spent to much time faffing about distracting myself and besides I had just soldered
the PicoZX board for the ZXSpectrum Pico and I wondered if I could get the Atari-800 emulator from before working on
the PicoZX, meaning I could switch between Spectrum and Atari on the same Pico.

Well, mission accomplished.

One thing I do not have is the ability to use the UI menu to pick the game from the /800 folder, it picks the 2nd file
and loads it auto-magically, which just happens to be Alien Ambush.rom
